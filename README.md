# Comprehensive Patient Health Analysis & Wellness Guidance Tool  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project aims to build a comprehensive **AI-driven health analysis and wellness guidance tool**. The system is designed to:  
- Predict potential diseases from patient health information.  
- Provide **personalized lifestyle recommendations** based on risk factors.  
- Deliver **interactive health guidance** via a conversational AI assistant.  

Unlike existing solutions that either focus only on diagnosis or provide generic advice, this project integrates both, offering patients a **holistic view of their health** alongside actionable wellness planning.
